# SpaceXplore-Core
SpaceXplore-Core is the foundational repository for the SpaceXplore: The Interstellar Exploration Initiative. It contains the core technologies and algorithms for advanced propulsion systems, autonomous robotic probes, and data transmission solutions designed for interstellar exploration. This repository serves as the central hub for development, collaboration, and integration of innovative tools and frameworks aimed at enabling robotic missions to nearby star systems and enhancing our understanding of exoplanets and their potential for habitability.

# SpaceXplore-Core

## Overview
SpaceXplore-Core is the foundational repository for the SpaceXplore: The Interstellar Exploration Initiative. This project aims to develop advanced technologies for interstellar exploration, focusing on propulsion systems, autonomous robotic probes, and data transmission solutions. Our goal is to send robotic missions to nearby star systems to gather critical data about exoplanets and their potential for habitability.

## Features
- **Advanced Propulsion Systems**: Implementations of ion drives, solar sails, and nuclear thermal propulsion.
- **Robotic Exploration Probes**: Autonomous navigation and biosignature detection capabilities.
- **Data Transmission Solutions**: High-bandwidth laser communication and error correction algorithms.

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   1 git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/SpaceXplore-Core.git
   2 cd SpaceXplore-Core
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**: Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. You can create a virtual environment using:

   ```bash
   1 python -m venv venv
   2 source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
   
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   1 pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
## Usage Guidelines

- To run the propulsion system simulations, navigate to the src/propulsion directory and execute:

   ```bash
   1 python ion_drive.py
   ```

- For robotic probe functionalities, navigate to the src/robotics directory and run:

   ```bash
   1 python autonomous_navigation.py
   ```

- To test the communication systems, go to the src/communication directory and execute:

   ```bash
   1 python laser_comm.py
   ```
